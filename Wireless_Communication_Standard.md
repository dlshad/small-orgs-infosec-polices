1.  *Purpose*

This standard specifies the technical requirements that wireless infrastructure devices must satisfy to connect to a \[ORG’S NAME\] network. Only those wireless infrastructure devices that meet the requirements specified in this standard or are granted an exception by the InfoSec Team are approved for connectivity to a \[ORG’S NAME\] network.

Network devices including, but not limited to, hubs, routers, switches, firewalls, remote access devices, modems, or wireless access points, must be installed, supported, and maintained by an Information Security consultant approved support organization.

> • Use Extensible Authentication Protocol-Fast Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST), Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP), or Extensible Authentication Protocol-Translation Layer Security (EAP-TLS) as the authentication protocol.
>
> • Use Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) or Advanced Encryption System (AES) protocols with a minimum key length of 256 bits.
>
> • All Bluetooth devices must use Secure Simple Pairing with encryption enabled.

**4.2 Guests and Isolated Wireless Device Requirements**

> • Guests’ WiFi Service Set Identifier (SSID) must be different from \[ORG’S NAME\] production device SSID.
>
> • Broadcast of guests’ network must be isolated from the \[ORG’S NAME\]’s network.

**4.3 Home Wireless Device Requirements**

All home wireless infrastructure devices that provide direct access to a \[ORG’S NAME\] network, such as those behind Enterprise Teleworker (ECT) or hardware VPN, must adhere to the following:

> • Enable WiFi Protected Access Pre-shared Key (WPA-PSK), EAP-FAST, PEAP, or EAP-TLS
>
> • When enabling WPA-PSK, configure a complex shared secret key (at least 20 characters) on the wireless client and the wireless access point

• Disable broadcast of SSID

• Change the default SSID name

• Change the default login and password
