### Small Organizations InfoSec Polices

Small organizations' Information security policy templates cover different aspects of InfoSec issues, I put them based on my personal experience auditing small NGOs and Media organizations. 

These polices are based on:
* [SANS Institute ](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies)

* [FISMA](https://www.dhs.gov/fisma)
